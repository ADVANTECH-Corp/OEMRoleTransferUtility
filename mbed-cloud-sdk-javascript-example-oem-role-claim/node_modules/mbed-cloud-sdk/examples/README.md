# Mbed Cloud SDK Examples

These examples are designed to give developers a headstart with developing with the Mbed Cloud SDK for JavaScript.

They can be used as a basis for a solution or simply to understand how a feature is used.

Refer to the [Node.js](#node-js) section for command-line or server-based examples written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

Refer to the [Web](#web) section for examples of using the JavaScript browser bundles in a [single page web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).

The [Proxy](#proxy) section describes how a thin server can be used to inject an API key into a browser-based application, keeping the API key secret.

## Node js

### Usage

To run the Node examples, simply execute them using node:

```bash
$ node <path to example.js>
```

### API Keys

These examples utilise a [config.js](node/config.js) file which can read an API Key (and optionally a host) from an environment variable, a command line switch or from the file itself.

To use environment variables, set the varaible `MBED_CLOUD_API_KEY` prior to running the application. e.g.:

```bash
$ export MBED_CLOUD_API_KEY=<Mbed Cloud API Key>
```

To use a command line switch, pass your API key to the program being run. e.g.:

```bash
$ node <path to example.js> <Mbed Cloud API Key>
```

or:

```bash
$ node <path to example.js> --apiKey=<Mbed Cloud API Key>
```

You can also simply edit the [config.js](node/config.js) file and add your key.

### Remoting

__Note:__ Some of the Node examples utilise a webhook server which must be publicly visible. If development is being done using http://localhost, you can use tunnelling software such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your development server publicly.

### Examples

* __Get Device Events__ [device-events.js](node/device-events.js)

  This example pages all device events in Mbed Cloud and exports them to local files in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format.

* __Developer Certificate Header__ [certificate-header.js](node/certificate-header.js)

  This example creates (or overwrites) a developer certificate.
  This is then used to create a local `C` header file for connecting a device to Mbed Cloud Connect.

* __Add Trusted Certificate__ [trusted-certificate.js](node/trusted-certificate.js)

  This example creates (or overwrites) a trusted certificate.
  It creates a private key and x509 certificate locally using openssl and shows how to create a valid signature to upload with the certificate.

* __Webhook Server__ [webhook-server.js](node/webhook-server.js)

  This example creates a basic webhook server which registers for callbacks from Mbed Cloud and receives asynchronous notifications.
  Using the callbacks, the device/resource tree of connected devices is recursed, outputting the value for each resource.

  __Note:__ This example requires the `express` server to be installed. Please do this by running `$ npm install express`.

* __User, Key and Group Listing__ [users-keys-groups.js](node/users-keys-groups.js)

  This example is a command line interface to list users, keys and groups of Mbed Cloud.

## Web

### Usage

The web bundles support the [Universal Module Definition](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) specification and as such can be loaded using [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) module loaders such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) module loaders such as Node.js or by using [browser globals](http://vanilla-js.com/).

The web examples don't use a module loader, so each bundle is available as a browser global under the `MbedCloudSDK` namespace.

__Note:__ [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS) protects Mbed Cloud. CORS rules are a browser security feature which restricts cross-origin calls from unknown domains and is only a concern when you use the SDKs directly in a browser (not Node.js).
If using the SDKs in a browser (perhaps for a single page web application), the domain `localhost` has been whitelisted for Mbed Cloud to enable local development. Before deploying to production, any public domain will need to be whitelisted to avoid CORS restrictions. To do this, please contact Mbed Cloud support.

### API Keys

These examples utilise a [config.js](web/config.js) file which can read an API Key (and optionally a host) from a cookie, the query string or from the file itself.

To use the query string, pass your API key to the page being run. e.g.:

```
https://www.yourserver.com/<example.html>?<Mbed Cloud API Key>
```

or:

```
https://www.yourserver.com/<example.html>?apiKey=<Mbed Cloud API Key>
```

You can also simply edit the [config.js](web/config.js) file and add your key.

__Warning:__ Your API Key will be publicly visible in your web application when creating single page web applications, use this method only during development or with a read-only key with access to public data. An intermediate server to handle requests is recommended for production. This can be done by injecting the API key on the fly (see [Proxy](#proxy)).

### Examples

* __Pull Notifications__ [pull-notifications.html](web/pull-notifications.html)

  This example registers for callbacks from Mbed Cloud and receives asynchronous notifications.
  Using the callbacks, the device/resource tree of connected devices is recursed, outputting the value for each resource.

* __Device Management__ [device-management.html](web/device-management.html)

  This example shows how a management interface for devices can be implemented.

* __Device Query Management__ [query-management.html](web/query-management.html)

  This example allows management and running of device queries.

* __Firmware Management__ [firmware-management.html](web/firmware-management.html)

  This example allows management of firmware images and firmware manifests for use in update campaigns.

* __Campaign Management__ [campaign-management.html](web/campaign-management.html)

  This example allows creation of update campaigns with the ability to start and stop them.

* __Metrics__ [metrics.html](web/metrics.html)

  This example renders usage metrics over a specified period.

## Proxy

The [proxy folder](proxy/) contains a sample project showing how API calls to Mbed Cloud can be proxied to allow injection of an API key header. This enables the production of a single-page web application using the minified JavaScript bundles _without_ the API key in use being visible to the client.

__Note:__ The proxy requires the `express` server to be installed. Please do this by running `$ npm install express`.

To start the proxy server, run the npm start command from the root of the project:

```bash
> npm start
```

An express server should now be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) which allows you to `log in` with your API key. This is simply stored as a cookie and injected into the headers of subsequent API calls.

Once you are `logged in`, you should have access to running each of the web examples without having to explictly set the API key in the config file.
